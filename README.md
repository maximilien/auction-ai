### Exploring Luxury Auction 

**E. M. Maximilien**

#### Executive summary

In this project we are exploring luxury auction data and attempt to answer the question:

`What are the key factors that help increase selling prices of luxury auction items?`

#### Rationale

During the pandemic, the luxury industry saw a radid increase in luxury purchases and collecting, e.g., wristwatches. While this lasted a few years, the rapid decline in interst and increase in pices (inflation) caused a reverse. These twin fact imply that there will be an increase of luxury items on the market and at auctions houses.

#### Research Question

What are the key factors that help increase selling prices of luxury auction items?

#### Data Sources



#### Methodology
* Use baisc explorary data analysis
* Build regression and classifier models
* Hyperparameter tuning of mpdels

#### Results
* `SVC` had the best accuracy to predict which item would sell and price but took long time to improve
* `LinearRegression` was good enough with accuracy score close to the best models

#### Next steps
* Explore what feaures we could discard
* Explore the most important features in the best models
* Explore whether bid time impact sell price
* Explore if bidder had impact on sell price
